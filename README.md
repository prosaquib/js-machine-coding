# JavaScript Machine Coding Question Collection

## üöÄ Welcome to the Ultimate JavaScript Problem-Solving Repository!

This repository is a curated collection of JavaScript machine coding questions, featuring some of the most challenging and frequently asked problems in technical interviews at top-tier tech companies like Uber, Paytm, and others. Whether you're preparing for a coding interview, enhancing your problem-solving skills, or simply exploring advanced JavaScript concepts, this repository is your go-to resource.

### üéØ Why This Repository?

As JavaScript continues to dominate the world of web development, mastering it is more important than ever. This collection focuses on practical, real-world problems that not only test your knowledge of JavaScript but also your ability to think critically and write clean, efficient code under pressure. Each problem in this repository has been carefully selected and documented to provide a clear understanding of the challenges you might face in technical interviews.

### üìö What's Inside?

- **Comprehensive Problem Statements**: Detailed descriptions of each problem, including requirements and constraints.
- **Real-World Scenarios**: Problems that mirror real-world applications, helping you understand how JavaScript is used in production environments.
- **Solutions**: Thoughtfully crafted solutions, with explanations that break down complex logic into understandable steps.
- **Interview-Level Challenges**: Problems that have been asked in interviews at companies like Uber and Paytm, ensuring you're prepared for the toughest questions.
- **Best Practices**: Code that adheres to JavaScript best practices, demonstrating how to write clean, maintainable, and efficient code.

### üìå Featured Problems

- **Custom `mapLimit` Function**: Implement a version of the `map` function with a concurrency limit. This problem, inspired by real interview questions, challenges your understanding of asynchronous programming in JavaScript.
- **Debounce Function**: Write a function that limits the rate at which a function can fire, a common problem in building responsive UIs.
- **Deep Clone Object**: Develop a deep cloning function that correctly handles nested objects, arrays, and edge cases.
- **Event Emitter**: Create an event emitter class that mimics the core functionality of event-driven architectures in JavaScript.
